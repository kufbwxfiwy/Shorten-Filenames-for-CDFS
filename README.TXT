** QBASIC script which shortens long filenames so that they
can fit on a CD/DVD. With name restoration functionality. **

This utility takes a directory listing and produces two
batch files, one which shortens long filenames so that they
can be put on CD/DVD and another one which will restore them
to their originality. Place the latter with the shortened
name files on the CD/DVD.

Use at own risk. This program was written in a robust manner
but author takes no responsibility for disasters.
