# Shorten-Filenames-for-CDFS

**QBASIC script which shortens long filenames so that they
can fit on a CD/DVD, with name restoration functionality.**

This utility takes a directory listing and produces two
batch files, one which shortens long filenames so that they
can be put on a CD/DVD and another one which will restore
them to their originality. Place the latter with the
shortened file names on the CD/DVD.

Please note that for some undefined reason the download
offered by GitHub is different from the one I uploaded (i.e.
the one actually shown in the window). You can test this
yourself by downloading the zip file and then comparing it
line-per-line with what is shown in the window. This means
that **what the window shows is the correct version, so just
copy and paste from the window and make sure you paste into
a plain text file.**

**Disclaimer: Use at own risk. This program was written in a
robust manner but author takes no responsibility for
disasters.**
